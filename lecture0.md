## Goal

By the end of this workshop, you will have built a Ge'ez digit recognition system using a Deep-Learning technique. 

The ML techniques you will see in this workshop apply to a wide variety of artificial intelligence problems and will serve as the foundation for further study in any application area you choose to pursue.

Before trying to define the contours of artificial intelligence, let us first reflect on the these words.

.italic[".bold[What is intelligence, anyway?] It is only a word that people use to name those unknown processes with which our brains
solve problems we call hard. But whenever you learn a skill yourself, you're less impressed or mystified when other people
do the same.

This is why .bold[the meaning of "intelligence" seems so elusive]: it describes not some definite thing but only the
momentary horizon of .bold[our ignorance about how minds might work]. It is hard for scientists who try to understand intelligence
to explain precisely what they do, since our working definitions change from year to year. But it is not at all unusual for
sciences to aim at moving targets." -- Marvin Minsky]

# What is missing?

Intelligence is not just about **pattern recognition**, which is something most of these works are based on.

It is about *modeling the world*:
- explaining and understanding what we see;
- imagining things we could see but haven't yet;
- problem solving and planning actions to make these things real;
- building new models as we learn more about the world.
