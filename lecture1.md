# What is Machine Learning

## ML: What is it good for?

- *Problems with longs lists of rules* 
    - when the traditional approach fails, machine learning may help.
- *Continually changing environments* 
    - machine learning can learn and adapt to new scenarios. 
- *Discovering insights within large collections of data* 
    - can you imagine trying to go through every transaction your (large) company has ever had by hand?

# What is Machine Learning

## ML: Terminology

- *Algorithms:* 
    - A set of rules and statistical techniques used to learn patters from data.
- *Model:* 
    - A model is what is trained using an ML algorithm.
- *Predictor Variable:* 
    - It is a feature(s) of the data that can be used to predict the output. 
- *Response Variable:* 
    - It is the output variable that needs to be predicted by using the predictor variables.
- *Training Data:* 
    - The data that is used to build the ML model. 
- *Testing Data:* 
    - The data that is used to evaluate the generalization of the trained ML model.

# Problem statement

Let us assume data $\mathbf{d} \sim p(\mathbf{x}, y)$ of $N$ example input-output pairs
    $$\mathbf{d} = \\\{ (\mathbf{x}\_1, y\_1), (\mathbf{x}\_2, y\_2), ..., (\mathbf{x}\_N, y\_N) \\\},$$
where
$\mathbf{x}\_i$ are the input data and
$y_i$ was generated by an unknown function $y\_i=f(\mathbf{x}\_i)$.

From this data, we want to find a function $h \in \mathcal{H}$ that approximates the true function $f$.

???

$\mathcal{H}$ is huge! How do we find a good hypothesis?

In general, $f$ will be **stochastic**. In this case, $y$ is not strictly a function $x$, and we wish to learn the conditional $p(y|\mathbf{x})$.

Most of supervised learning is actually (approximate) maximum likelihood estimation on (huge) parametric models.

## Feature vectors

- Input samples $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ are described as real-valued vectors of $d$ attributes or features values.
- If the data is not originally expressed as real-valued vectors, then it needs to be prepared and transformed to this format.
